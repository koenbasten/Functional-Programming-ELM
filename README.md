# Functional Programming Course - Fontys

Welcome to the repository for the Functional Programming course at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. This repository contains my answers and exercises for a 4-week course designed to introduce students to the principles and practices of functional programming.

## Course Overview

This course serves as an academic preparation for students, providing a solid foundation in functional programming concepts. Throughout the course, we used the ELM programming language to explore various functional programming techniques and paradigms.
